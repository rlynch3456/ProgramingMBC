/*
    This is what is known as a stub class.  The only code here is the minimum
    required in order for the class to build using the supplied makefile
    and to run the ShapeTest program without errors.
    
    It is up to the student to use the Circle.java as an example and fill in
    the missing pieces.  Think about what is needed; a constructor, getter
    and setter functions, etc...
