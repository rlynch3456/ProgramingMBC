Directory contents:

**helloworld.py** - Simple "Hello World" program, typically the first program anyone
would write when learning a new language.
    
**weather.py** - This is the program that we will be using in class.  It first shows a simple function
that advises what clothing to wear based on the temperature.  It is left to the student to expand
upon this program and add a function that will calculate the wind chill factor.expand
 
To run the programs:
        
`$python filename` or
        
`$./filename`
        
The later method works because of the first line in each .py (#!/usr/bin/python3) file instructs
the bash shell (command prompt) how to run the program.  We have also set the file attributes to +x
which tags the file as something that can execute.
