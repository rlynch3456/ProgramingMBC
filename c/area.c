    The purpose of this program is to demonstrate simple functions in C.
    
    The student is expected to add a function to calculate the area of a
    rectangle, check for valid input and write simple test cases.

/*  ToDo: create a function here to calculate the area of
    a rectangle.  This function will take two integers as parameters
    and return the area.
    
    The function should check for invalid input.  Can a rectangle
    have a negative or zero area?  Hmmm, I do not think so.  The
    function should check for incorrect input values and return error.

// ToDo: Write your function here, maybe call it AreaRect


/*
    Let's make some test cases to make sure that our function is working
    correctly.
    
    Assume that our function is called areaRect.
    We know that the area of a 2x3 rectangle shoudl be 6, so we could
    have a test like this
    
    int area;
    
    area = areaRect(2,3);
    
    Now check the result
    
    if(areaRect != 6)
        printf("Error\n");
        
    What other tests could we do?  Could the area be zero or a negative number?
    
    The test function should return the results of the test.  Typically this
    would be zero for no error, and something other than zero to indiciate failure.
